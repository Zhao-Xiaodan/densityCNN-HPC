==============================================================
Generated: Mon Feb  9 03:52:25 PM +08 2026
Job ID: 555208.stdct-mgmt-02
Node: GN-A40-012
Total Execution Time: 2 minutes
Successful Experiments: 4/4

🐛 DEBUG FIXES APPLIED:
=======================
✅ Enhanced preprocessing enabled (keeps images at 512x512)
✅ Enhanced model architecture enabled
✅ Fixed dilution factor pattern matching (dilution_50x_ format)
✅ Added prediction range diagnostics during training
✅ Early termination if R² < 0 after 10 epochs
✅ Verbose output layer diagnostics

DATASET INFORMATION:
====================
Dataset: ./dataset_20260201_beads calibration_S16-Basler camera
Images: 384 (512x512 cropped)
Dilution Series: 50x - 51200x (11 factors, double dilution)
Density Method: Blob DoG + 50x extrapolated (R²=0.9956)
Data Percentage: 100%

COMPARISON TO FAILED EXPERIMENTAL STUDY:
=========================================
Original experimental study (20260204_150508):
  - ALL 4 experiments failed (R² < 0)
  - Issue 1: Resized images to 224x224 (lost information)
  - Issue 2: Used standard model instead of enhanced

DEBUG version fixes:
  - Keeps images at 512x512 (preserves all information)
  - Uses enhanced model architecture
  - Fixed dilution factor pattern matching
  - Expected: R² > 0.95 (based on architecture study)
